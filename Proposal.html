            <section>
                <h3>False Recommendation:</h3>
                <p>
                    Many users today don't have time to pay attention to new songs, so they stick to their old playlists. 
                    And many of these apps still have the problem of incorrect music recommendations (for example, pop music suddenly played after rock music), 
                    which makes people even less willing to try new playlists.

                <h3>Promotion of New Artists:</h3>
                <p>
                    In recent music apps, we rarely see the promotion of new artists' music. This often leaves us stuck in the 
                    old artists and unable to try new music. And some artists with ideas can't get their music appreciated and disseminated.

                <h3>Existing Attempt:</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently, Spotify can search playlists by keyword, but such playlist recommendations are created manually 
                    by existing users and based on keyword input. What we're trying to do is generate your own playlist directly from keywords.
                </p>

        </li>
        <li><h2>Addressing the Problem</h2>
            <p>
                We believe that creating a playlist-generating application website can broaden the audience's taste of music. It can make more people interested in music 
            and willing to try new music styles and works. Listening to the same old playlist for too long can make people lose interest in music, and such an app is bound to solve this problem.

        <li><h2>Proposed Application</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Target Group & Solution:</h3>
                <p>
                    As people listen to their favorite songs for a long time, they would feel bored with music styles. Our web app resolves that problem by building an online music web. Users will 
                    be free to explore all kinds of music styles in our app. Engaging in new styles and exploring the old ones. Anyone who listens to music would be our target group.

                <h3>Major Features & Problem Resolving:</h3>
                <p>
                    Users would utilize this app to look for songs, listen to songs, and form lists of songs for future listening. We have three interactive features provided. Firstly, we help minority singer 
                    groups and minority language groups to have more influence and get recognized. People usually listen to a few songwriters, yet ignoring other music that has similar styles. To broaden 
                    one's song lists with their preferred style, we could combine similar songs and provide them to audiences. Secondly, separating music genres to have different sections could be helpful for 
                    people to jump between genres. If a person decided to switch from non-vocal to vocal, we could recommend he or she listen to the top ratings in the style. It might help him or her to quickly adapt 
                    to another style. Thirdly, our platform could produce a compressed list of music that could be played on different platforms. Suppose you want to recommend a list of songs to a friend, but you don't use the same 
                    music app. Our app creates a compressed file of a list of songs that is runnable in different music apps. It connects people from different music platforms to discuss.

                <h3>Information Retrieval: Generation of csv files for song lists.</h3>
                <p>
                    This app broadens people's taste in music by connecting them to different music genres and songs. Jumping out of an old music list could invoke new genre interest and discover more songs in similar styles.
